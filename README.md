# Layer-Two-Network-Experiments
This repository contains code to perform experiments for Layer 2 Blockchains.

In order to run the experiment code, please download the zip file and refer to the provided PDF documents. <br />
The Part 1 document will walk you through on how to create and deploy your own smart contract on the Layer 1 Ropsten test network. <br />
The Part 2 document will walk you through on how to deploy on other test networks such as Layer 2 Arbitrum, Layer 2 Matic, and IOTA EVM. <br />
The Block Explorer URL Links document presents links to respective testnet block explorers that show the on-chain deployment of contracts and transaction details explored in this research paper. <br />

The zip file also includes keys to a curated Metamask wallet that contains faucet funds to deploy contracts on testnets. <br />
